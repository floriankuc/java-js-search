# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.
This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.


The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring Boot is [springdoc](https://springdoc.org).
Springdoc will generate an OpenAPI v3 specification based on the generated Controller and Model classes.
The specification is available to download using the following url:
http://localhost:8443/v3/api-docs/

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.html

Change default port value in application.properties

## About

This server is currently not hooked up to a database. A dataloader parses some provided JSON data into POJOs to act as a persistence layer.

It holds this persistence data in form of `Person`s but will only serve `PersonDTO`s according to data minimisation.

## Tests

Run `mvn test`
